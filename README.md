Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. The numbers will always be >= 0 and <= 999. You can assume that the user will always supply you with an integer within this range and do not need to "test" this number to ensure that it falls within the range.

Next, you will be performing a series of computations that will require you to isolate specific digits in each number based on their place value. You will also be computing a "super number" which is the result of a series of additional calculations using these values.
